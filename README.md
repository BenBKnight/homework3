## Homework 3
Password Generator

## Initial thoughts and room to improve
This was a challenging assignment. I wanted to, and might go back, make this more efficient as far as the code goes. I understand I wrote a ton for something that could probably be written in a few lines. My thoughts of making it more efficient would probably include an object with an array for each set of characters. I also think that my function could be more straight forward, with less "if" statements and less local variables.

## What I think I did well
First, I did not go to many outside resources for detailed help. I wanted to see how much I could do on my own. I gathered some information from sources, but the majority of the logic was on my own. The second thing I became proud of was having the textarea clear after every generate. This was probably an easy fix to an experienced programmer, but it took me some time, probably too much, to find the solution to that.
